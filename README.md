# the-lost-notes-that-i-forgot-about
its all the info i forgot about

if you do // you can comment and it will not enter as a code
if you do /* you can see a type a lot of comment */ to stop the comment

everytime you write a java file you always need to do public class then the title of the flie { }
java codes need to be in a class

public static void main(String[] args){ 
}
this is the main method it is the start of the code so it will be first thing that starts
; is the . for coding
every java needs a main method

int someInt = 89
int someint always has to be numbers

int someLong = 99999 
just a way to say a longer number

String someString = "reeee"
just a way to say words and something thats not one letter

boolean aBool = true or false
just a way to do true or false statement

double someDouble = 0.4
just a decimal point if it has a . it needs double

char aChar = 'e'
just one letter never use this its old and useless but it comes up in old codes

a data can only be its own data type

int math = 2+4;
operation its just like math stuff like 9 + 10 = 21

math++; or math--;
to change the value ++ is adding a value and -- is getting rid of a value

everytime you want to make a new java file you need to put Filename.java
the first letter always needs to be capitalized
Filenames are like proper nouns they are always capitalized

how to clone: git clone the "link" 

variables
datatype name = something of data
variables are used to store information
example String name = "something"

java is strictly typed = you always need the right data type or else it will not work

these are all of the data type
String aString = "sentances"; // things with multiple characters
int aInt = 1; / just a number
long aLong = 100000000; / a really really really really really big number
double aDouble = 1.60; / a decimal number
char = aChar = "a"; / a single letter this sucks
boolean aBoolean = true; / a true or false

numbers systems
they always need system.out.printin(numbers);
you can use + - * / % < > <= >=

how to push go to terminal git add .
git commit -m "say what you added"
